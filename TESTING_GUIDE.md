# Testing Guide: Cloud Platform Products with Selection

## How to Test the New Selection Feature

### Step 1: Basic Setup
1. Open the application at `http://localhost:5174`
2. Enter a project name (e.g., "My Test Project")
3. Select team personas (e.g., Developer, DevOps)

### Step 2: Trigger Products Display
1. Select a **Project Type**: Choose "Web Application"
2. Choose an **Architecture Pattern**: Select "Microservices"
3. Select a **Cloud Platform**: Choose "AWS", "Azure", or "GCP"

### Step 3: Observe Selection Features
You should now see a "Cloud Platform Services" card with:

#### AWS Example (Microservices Architecture):
- **üíª Compute**
  - *Virtual Machines*: Dropdown with "EC2" (‚≠ê Most Popular) and "Lightsail" options
- **üóÉÔ∏è Database** 
  - *Relational*: "RDS" (‚≠ê Most Popular) - single option
  - *NoSQL*: "DynamoDB" (‚≠ê Most Popular) - single option
- **üê≥ Container**
  - *Orchestration*: Dropdown with "ECS" (‚≠ê Most Popular) and "EKS" options

#### Selection Behavior:
- **Star Icons (‚≠ê)**: Indicate most popular services (rank 1)
- **Default Selection**: Most popular service is pre-selected
- **Dropdown Menus**: Appear only when multiple options exist
- **Comparison Info**: Shows "X alternative options available"

### Step 4: Test Different Combinations
Try different combinations to see how services change:

1. **AWS + Client-Server**: Should show EC2, RDS, S3
2. **AWS + Serverless-Backend**: Should show Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway
3. **Azure + Microservices**: Should show App Service, SQL Database, AKS with Container Instances as alternative
4. **GCP + Client-Server**: Should show Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage

### Step 5: Test Selection Changes
1. Find a category with multiple options (e.g., AWS Compute with EC2/Lightsail)
2. Use the dropdown to switch between options
3. Notice how the details update immediately
4. Observe the star icon (‚≠ê) indicating the most popular choice

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Only relevant services for the selected architecture appear
- ‚úÖ Most popular services are pre-selected and marked with ‚≠ê
- ‚úÖ Dropdown menus only appear when multiple options exist
- ‚úÖ Service details update immediately when selection changes
- ‚úÖ Alternative options count is shown at the bottom of each service card
- ‚úÖ Cloud Platform card shows count of available services

### Features to Verify
1. **Popularity Ordering**: Services in dropdowns are ordered by popularity
2. **Architecture Filtering**: Only services supporting the selected architecture appear
3. **Smart Defaults**: Most popular options are pre-selected
4. **Visual Indicators**: Star icons mark popular services
5. **Responsive UI**: Dropdowns only appear when needed
6. **Information Rich**: Each service shows comprehensive details

This new feature provides a much more sophisticated and user-friendly way to explore and select cloud services based on architecture patterns and popularity rankings.
