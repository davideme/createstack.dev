## üîÑ Features to MODIFY (High Priority)

### 1. **Technology Stack Builder ‚Üí Stack Gap Analyzer**

**Current State**: Ground-up wizard for new technology decisions  
**New Approach**: Input existing technologies, identify missing components

#### Changes Required:
- **Input Method**: Change from "start from scratch" to "what do you already have?"
- **Analysis Engine**: Build gap detection across critical categories
- **Output Format**: "Missing components" instead of "recommended stack"

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// New interface for existing stack input
interface ExistingStack {

  }[]
  compliance_gaps?: ComplianceGap[]
}
```

#### User Experience Changes:
