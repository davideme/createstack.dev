## Technical Architecture

### Type System
```typescript
// Core types for stack analysis
interface ExistingStack {
  programming_languages?: string[]
  frameworks?: string[]
  databases?: string[]
  // ... 15+ categories
}

interface StackGapAnalysis {
  completeness_score: number
  missing_categories: string[]
  recommended_additions: StackGapRecommendation[]
  compliance_gaps?: ComplianceGap[]
}
```

### Analysis Engine
- **Modular design**: Separate analysis functions for different tool categories
- **Configurable scoring**: Priority-weighted completeness calculation
- **Extensible recommendations**: Easy addition of new tool categories
- **Context-aware filtering**: Team size and expertise-based tool filtering

### Component Architecture
- **StackGapAnalyzer**: Main orchestration component
- **StackInput**: Technology input and context collection
- **StackAnalysisResults**: Results visualization and recommendations
- **Modular UI**: Reusable components with consistent design

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. **Stack Categories Configuration**
```typescript
export const stackCategories: StackCategory[] = [
  {
    id: "security",
    name: "Security Tools",
    priority: "critical",
    required_for_compliance: ["soc2", "hipaa", "pci"]
  }
  // ... 15 categories total
];
```

### 2. **Recommendation Algorithm**
- **Context filtering**: Tools filtered by team size and technical expertise
- **Popularity scoring**: Algorithmic scoring based on features, pricing, and platform support
- **Integration difficulty assessment**: Easy/medium/hard ratings for implementation planning
- **Cost estimation**: Monthly costs, setup time, and training requirements

### 3. **Compliance Analysis**
- **Framework mapping**: Categories required for SOC2, HIPAA, PCI compliance
- **Gap identification**: Missing controls and audit requirements
- **Cost estimation**: Compliance implementation costs and timelines
- **Regulatory guidance**: Specific requirements for different frameworks

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Traditional Stack Builder)
- Started with empty project setup
- Required decisions on everything from scratch
- No context about existing technologies
- Generic recommendations for all users

### After (Stack Gap Analyzer)
- Starts with "what do you already have?"
- Builds on existing technology decisions
- Provides missing component identification
- Context-aware recommendations based on team and industry
