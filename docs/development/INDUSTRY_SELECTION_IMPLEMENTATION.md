# Industry Selection Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added optional industry selection to the first card (Project Setup card) alongside the existing personas selection. Users can either select their industry for domain-specific recommendations or choose to skip industry selection for general recommendations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Industry Data Model
- **File**: `app/data/industries.ts`
- **Content**: 
  - Industry interface with id, name, emoji, description
  - Array of 8 industries including skip option:
    - **(Default)** No Industry / Skip ‚è≠Ô∏è (id: "none") 
    - Fintech üí∞
    - HR & Talent üë•
    - Sales & Productivity üìà
    - AI & Developer Tools ü§ñ
    - Healthcare & Biotech üè•
    - Consumer & Lifestyle üõçÔ∏è
    - Enterprise AI & SaaS Solutions üè¢

### 2. Updated Type Definitions
- **File**: `app/types/project.ts`
- **Change**: Added Industry interface export

### 3. Updated Database Schema
- **File**: `app/lib/db.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `industry?: string` field to Project interface
  - Updated saveCurrentProject function signature to include industry
  - Updated hook function signature to include industry

### 4. Updated Project Component
- **File**: `app/components/project.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added industry state variable with default "none"
  - Added industry import from data file
  - Updated database loading to include industry (defaults to "none")
  - Updated all save operations to include industry
  - Added industry to dependency array for auto-save
  - Updated clear data function to reset industry to "none"
  - Added industry selection UI between personas and project status
  - Made industry selection optional for project completion
  - Updated status message to adapt based on industry selection
  - Added conditional styling for skip vs specific industry selection

### 5. UI Implementation
The industry selection includes:
- Label marked as "(Optional)" to indicate it's not required
- Descriptive text explaining users can skip for general recommendations
- Select dropdown with emoji + name display for all options
- Default "No Industry / Skip" option with skip emoji (‚è≠Ô∏è)
- Information panel that appears for any selection:
  - Amber styling for specific industries
  - Gray styling for the skip option
- No validation requirement - project can proceed regardless of selection

## User Experience
1. User sees "Industry (Optional)" selection after personas selection
2. Default is "No Industry / Skip" indicating they can proceed without choosing
3. When any option is selected, an info panel shows with appropriate styling
4. Project status shows "ready" as soon as name and personas are filled
5. Status message adapts to mention industry focus OR general recommendations
6. Users can freely proceed with or without industry selection

## Technical Notes
- Industry selection is properly saved to IndexedDB
- Auto-save functionality includes industry changes
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Industry data is structured for easy extension
- TypeScript types are properly defined throughout the system
- Uses "none" as skip value (compatible with Radix UI Select component)
- No validation prevents project completion
- Conditional messaging based on industry selection

## Design Philosophy
- **Optional by Design**: Industry selection doesn't block project creation
- **Clear Communication**: UI clearly indicates the optional nature
- **Flexible Recommendations**: System works with or without industry context
- **User Choice**: Respects users who prefer general vs specific recommendations
