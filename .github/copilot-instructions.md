### General Guidelines
- **File Length**: Keep files under 1000 lines of code. Break into smaller files if needed.
- **Function Length**: Keep functions under 300 lines of code. Break into smaller functions if needed.
- **Folder Content**: The total content of a folder should not exceed 10,000 lines of code. Break large folders into smaller, more focused subdirectories if needed.
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all code with proper type definitions
- **Component Organization**: Group related components in appropriate directories
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, kebab-case for file names and PascalCase for components

### React Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer custom hooks for complex logic
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
- Use proper TypeScript types for props and state

### Software engineering principles:

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Single Responsibility Principle
Composition over Inheritance
Reusability & Maintainability

### UX Guidelines
 - Use consistent UX patterns across the application.
 - Use radix components for UI elements before custom components.
 - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
